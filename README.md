# Project 2 Starter Code

This repository contains the starter code for Project 2!

For comprehensive documentation, see the Project 2 Spec (https://cs161.org/proj2/).

Write your implementation in `client/client.go` and your integration tests in `client_test/client_test.go`. Optionally, you can also use `client/client_unittest.go` to write unit tests (e.g: to test your helper functions).

To test your implementation, run `go test -v` inside of the `client_test` directory. This will run all tests in both `client/client_unittest.go` and `client_test/client_test.go`.
